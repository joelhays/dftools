### Code Alliance Outlaws Specifications Version 0.2
Dump from:

https://web.archive.org/web/20010124073000/http://www.code-alliance.com:80/~editors/outlaws/docs/ol_specs/olspecs.htm

There is only one snapshot on archive.org, so I have dumped the pages as text files and duplicated them here.

Many links within these text files simply refer to other parts of the specifications, so there is no need to follow the links.
