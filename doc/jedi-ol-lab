Jedi Engine Asset Archive Format for Outlaws (LAB)

Lucas Asset(s) Blob?
Lucas Asset(s) Binary?

This is an archive format, not unlike Star Wars: Dark Forces' GOB format or DOOM's WAD format.

David Lovejoy and Alexei Novikov's Outlaws specifications document this format.

See the following:

It seems Guilherme Lampert was also able to pick-apart the format as well:

I was able to decipher the format before discovering these works.


All multi-byte values are little-endian unless noted otherwise.

All character values are from the ASCII character set.

Fields without '=' have values that will vary.

Fields are described in order of appearance.

Curly braces '{' and '}' are used to logically seperate descriptions.
